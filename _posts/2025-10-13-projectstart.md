title: Getting Started with a Game Design Project
---
When we begin a new project in the game development space, there's a whole period before preproduction that we often glaze over in the education process surrounding how to become a game developer, a game designer. 

That process is essentially, "What are we doing and how have others tried to do things? Given those attempts, how can we capitalize on their mistakes while avoiding making them ourselves?" Along those lines, we are seeking to design a game that focuses on supply chain logistics with an approach that affords for potential insertion of independent, custom, large-language models to be inserted. 

This will be a board game that is also going to be a bit of a mixed-media platform that is focused on 2 key things: 

1. Educating the public about the logistics of this specific client. 
2. Training their workforce to think about the variety of problems that can occur within these logistics. 

And so, we have begun that process. Because we're focusing on 3 things, it is important here to contextualize while keeping the specifics out of the public discussion. We are focusing on: 

1. Moving stuff from one place to another where things can go wrong. 
2. At times, this will focus on travel to outer space. 
3. There is an asymmetry to all of this. 

As a result, we have focused on thinking through the mechanics of a number of games. For this project, at the moment, we are focusing on:
